### Summary
This report showcases the findings from a movie recommender system built as part of the
final project for DSC478. Initially, the user is shown the top 50 movies based on the IMDB
weighted score and IMDB popularity. The user picks 5 movies that they have seen before and
rates them out of 10. The recommender system is built using these algorithms: Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Singular Value Decomposition, Cosine Similarity
and K nearest Neighbors. It then performs bagging based on majority vote to find the best
movie recommendations based on the different results from the various algorithms. The
algorithm then returns the top 10 movie picks for the user. The various algorithms and their
recommendations are then evaluated.

### Dataset Overview
As part of the knowledge discovery process, data integration, cleaning and visualization were
performed on the dataset to obtain the most useful information. The datasets on Kaggle were
originally collected from the IMDB website. Some more data had been added before being
posted on Kaggle. The dataset had 45,000 movies with variables such as cast, crew, plot
keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies,
countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages and had 7 total files containing other
information like cast, crew and IMDB user ratings.

### Conclusion
The paper showcases the entire Knowledge Discovery Pipeline. It goes from data integration,
data cleaning, data visualization and data mining. The recommender system is built using
these algorithms: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Singular Value
Decomposition, Cosine Similarity and K nearest Neighbors. The user enters 5 movies and the
algorithm combines the different results from the various machine learning models to
recommend 5 movies to the user. The algorithm also lays down the groundwork for a more
complex recommender system.
